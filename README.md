# Leaf_Disease_Indentification
This project, built upon the renowned 'Plant-Village' dataset, is a testament to my passion for pushing the boundaries of innovation in various datasets. It represents a significant milestone in my journey of programming and research, undertaken during my undergraduate years. Notably, I ventured into uncharted territory by implementing this model at a time when the cutting-edge EfficientNet was still in its infancy. My goal was not only to enrich my programming skills but also to expand my expertise in the field of research. This project showcases my dedication to staying at the forefront of technology and my relentless pursuit of knowledge.
